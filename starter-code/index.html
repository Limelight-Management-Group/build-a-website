<p>Hello and Welcome to The Limelight's About Us page. The Limelight was founded to redefine the artists' development process for the web-age, plain and simple.

We create rich internet applications, where those who make music can develop themselves by utilizing our platforms. We offer ways for musicians to digitally distribute new music, create a fan base and for other music professionals to network with those who may add value to their careers. Moreover, music marketers can target their users with our platforms and Ad-tech.

This is what the limelight is; this what TLLIS does.
